== GraphQL

In this chapter I'll be reviewing some basic concepts about what is
GraphQL and what it could be used for.

=== What is GraphQL ?

GraphQL is a query language. It's been created to ease the way a given
client can query some data from an underlying storage engine.

The way those queries are declared is done using a type system you
define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or
storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.

IMPORTANT: For a full detailed explanation about GraphQL I would
recommend you to take a look at the official tutorial at
