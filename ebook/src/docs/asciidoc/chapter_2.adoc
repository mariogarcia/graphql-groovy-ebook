== GQL and GraphQL

**GQL** is a set of Groovy DSLs and AST transformations built on top
of https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java[GraphQL-java] to make
it easier building GraphQL schemas and execute **GraphQL** queries
without losing type safety. Some of the ideas behind **GQL**:

- It should be **IDE friendly**
- It should be built having **static compilation** in mind
- It should **not need more than one import**

The following script will repeat the execution lifecycle I showed in
the previous chapter.

=== Groovy script

[source, groovy]
----
include::{gql}/scripts/chapter1/script.groovy[]
----

<1> Create a simple type
<2> Create the schema
<3> Execute the query

[ditaa]
....
 +---------+ enables +-----------+ enables +---------+ enables +---------+
 |   (1)   +-------->|    (2)    +-------->|   (3)   +-------->|  (3)    |
 |  types  |         | to schema |         |  expose |         | execute |
 +---------+         +-----------+         +---------+         +---------+
....

=== Gradle

To use `GQL` add the dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

[source, groovy]
----
include::{gql}/build.gradle[]
----

=== Declaring types

[source, groovy]
----
include::{gql}/src/test/groovy/chapter2/TypesSpec.groovy[tags=type, indent=0]
----


=== Queries and mutations

(TODO)

=== Scalars
