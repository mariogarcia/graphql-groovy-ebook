== GraphQL + Ratpack

"Ratpack is a set of Java libraries for building scalable HTTP
applications.  It is a lean and powerful foundation, not an
all-encompassing framework."

=== Hello GraphQL

One of the nice features of Groovy is that you can create a script to
prototype before diving into creating a full featured one. The
following Groovy script creates a fully functional GraphQL HTTP
application.

=== Fortune Cookies

In the rest of this chapter I will be building a fortune cookies
project. This Ratpack project will be built with the Gradle build
tooling.

==== Gradle project

To create a Ratpack/Gradle project is pretty straight forward thanks
to http://www.sdkman.io[SDKMan] and
https://github.com/pledbrook/lazybones[Lazybones]. First of all
install **sdkman** following the instructions found in its site. Then
add the following property to your `$HOME/.lazybones/config.groovy`
(create the file if it doesn't exists yet)

[source, groovy]
.config.groovy
----
bintrayRepositories = [
  "ratpack/lazybones"
]
----

That will make available the Ratpack latest templates to create a
Ratpack project. Once this property has been set then you can start
using Lazybones to create your first project.

[source, shell]
.shell
----
lazybones create ratpack 1.5.1 fortune-cookies-ratpack
----

This will create a new project called `ratpack-graphql-sample` with
the following structure (copied from Lazybones execution).

      |            +- // Spock tests in here!
      |
      |
      +- build.gradle // Gradle configuration
----

==== GQL

Now that we have the basic structure of a Ratpack project, add the
`gql-ratpack` dependency in your `build.gradle`:

[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::{ratpack}/build.gradle[tags=gql-ratpack, indent=0]
----

==== Schema

We are almost ready to go. We need to create a minimal schema. But
instead of coding the schema with Groovy we're going to use GraphQL
syntax directly modularising the schema. Modularising the way you
create GraphQL schemas has at least a couple of benefits:

- Enables you to write using plain GraphQL language: Writing code is
cool, but you may be used to writing GraphQL schemas using the GraphQL
language directly.
- It also allows you to separate parts of the schema by areas of
interest: No more a huge single file declaring everything in one place

The application we're creating serves random fortune cookies. For that
purpose we need to define the GraphQL type `Cookie` in
`src/main/resources/schema`.

[source, groovy]
.Cookie.graphql
----
include::{ratpack}/src/main/resources/schema/Cookie.graphql[indent=0]
----

Because all types must be linked to the schema, now it's time for the
schema declaration:

[source, groovy]
.Schema.graphql
----
include::{ratpack}/src/main/resources/schema/Schema.graphql[indent=0]
----

<1> Wrapping all queries within the `Queries` type
<2> Set `Queries` type as the type for the queries (I know it sounds
redundant, isn't it ? :P)

To make the schema available to the GraphQL handler we need to load
the schema definition and register it in the Ratpack's
registry. Although we could add it directly to the `Ratpack.groovy` as
we did in the `Hello GraphQL` section, but in a more complex
application is always worth keep things separate.

In the case of this application we would like to create a
`javax.inject.Provider` that provides a `GraphQLSchema`. Having the
schema created by a provider brings us a series of benefits, the most
important one, make the schema aware of the Ratpack's registry. Maybe
that doesn't ring a bell yet, but we'll see how handy it is in a bit. For
now this is the code for the schema provider:

[source, groovy]
.SchemaProvider.groovy
----
include::{ratpack}/src/main/groovy/fortune/SchemaProvider.groovy[tags=initial, indent=0]
----

==== Handlers

Now open `Ratpack.groovy` and make available a GraphQL and GraphiQL
handlers. Those handlers will expose the execution engine and the
GraphiQL console in two different HTTP endpoints. We also have to set
the `GraphQLModule`, this module will connect the handlers with the
schema we'll be creating later on.

[source, groovy]
.Ratpack.groovy
----
include::{ratpack}/src/ratpack/Ratpack.groovy[tags=initial, indent=0]
----

<1> GraphQLModule will expose the schema
<2> GraphQL handler will be exposed at `/graphql` path
<3> GraphiQL console will be exposed at `/graphql/browser` path

Although we won't be serving any data yet, but we can bootstrap the
application to check how the schema looks like in the GraphiQL
console. So run the application and open the browser at
`http://localhost:5050/graphql/browser`

[source, shell]
.run application
----
./gradlew run
----

==== GraphiQL 101

If you have opened the browser you should be seeing this:

image::graphiql_initial.png[]

The most important zones of GraphiQL are:

- **Queries area** (Left)

Is where you will write your queries or mutations and then execute
them to get some results. GraphiQL gives you auto-completion
facilities to help you writing the queries, just write `{}` and inside
the braces do `CTRL-SPACE` and you'll see a pop up suggesting you
which queries you can use.

image::graphiql_query_autocompletion.png[]

- **Parameters tab** (Lower left)

Right below the Queries are is the query parameter area. That area
should be used to set the parameters used by a query. The same way you
could use auto-completion in the query area, you can do the same
here. GraphiQL knows which parameters you shoud be using for the
declared query.

- **Execution Result area** (Right)

Whenever you execute a query, whether clicking on the `play` button or
using the keystroke `CTRL-ENTER`, the result will be shown in the right
area.

image::graphiql_execution_result.png[]

NOTE: At the moment we are only exposing the schema because there is
no data that's why the query result shows `null` values. We'll be
providing some dummy data in the next section.

- **Schema explorer** (Upper right)

Located in the upper right zone, there is a `Docs` button. That button
will show a schema explorer. You can navigate through the schema to
check types, fields and its restrictions.

image::graphiql_schema_explorer.png[]

==== Prototyping data

Ok we have exposed the schema, but so far it doesn't serve any data,
maybe front-end developers in our team are asking us to make some data
available to start developing the UI but we haven't created the
database connection yet. Well, we could provide some dummy data to
avoid blocking them until we have the db connection ready.

In the `SchemaProvider.groovy` we can add some data directly:

[source, groovy]
.SchemaProvider.groovy
----
include::{ratpack}/src/main/groovy/fortune/SchemaProvider.groovy[tags=dummy, indent=0]
----

<1> We would like to map some field in the `Queries` **type**
<2> Specifically the `randomCookie` **field**. We use a Closure with a
single parameter `env` to provide the data that will be served when
querying this field
<3> The response data. You can provide a map or an Object, the
important thing is that the fields of the object used correspond to
the fields declared in the schema. If a field doesn't match then the
result for that field will be `null`.

Now if you execute the `randomCookie` query in the GraphiQL console
you'll see the following.

image::graphiql_execution_prototyping.png[]

==== Real data

Prototyping is great to favor communication between back and front
developers, but at some point we should be serving real data. In the
fortune cookies application we're going to use a relational database
where the cookies are going to be stored.

Because this is a small application we'll be using
http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html[H2] which fits perfectly well
with our requirements. In order to use `H2` we need to add the driver
dependency to our `build.gradle`.

[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::{ratpack}/build.gradle[tags=h2, indent=0]
----

Next we need to create an instance of `javax.sql.DataSource` which
will create the database connetion. Once the data source has been put
in place, we need to add the `ratpack.groovy.sql.SqlModule`. This
module will create a `groovy.sql.Sql` instance that will be available
in the Ratpack's registry. That will come handy when injecting the
`Sql` object in our services. But we'll se that in a bit, first
let's declare datasource and module in `Ratpack.groovy` file.

[source, groovy]
.Ratpack.groovy
----
include::{ratpack}/src/ratpack/Ratpack.groovy[tags=embeddedDataSource, indent=0]
----

<1> `SqlModule` to create a `groovy.sql.Sql` instance available in the registry
<2> An instance of type `javax.sql.DataSource` required to create database connections.

Ok we've got a database connection, now it's time to create some
data. For the moment we're creating the data also in the
`Ratpack.groovy`.

[source, groovy]
.Ratpack.groovy
----
include::{ratpack}/src/ratpack/Ratpack.groovy[tags=withData, indent=0]
----

<1> We're creating a service that will execute at startup and will execute a series of
sql statements
<2> We take the `groovy.sq.Sql` instance from the registry

Ok we have data, the only task remaining is to be able to get that
data from the GraphQL query. That means to query the database from the
function we used to serve dummy data. Because we coded that in a
`provider` we can inject the `groovy.sql.Sql` instance in the provider
and use it from there:

[source, groovy]
.SchemaProvider.groovy
----
include::{ratpack}/src/main/groovy/fortune/SchemaProvider.groovy[tags=sqlInjected, indent=0]
----

<1> We inject the `Sql` instance to use it in our fetcher function
<2> Because the query is going to return a single instance of
`groovy.sql.GroovyResult` that extends Map, we can return it as result
of the fetcher function

Next time you go to the GraphiQL console and execute the query you'll
be getting data from the database.

==== Refactoring

Yes, it's time to do some refactoring. There're a couple of things I
would like to move outside `Ratpack.groovy` and the
`SchemaProvider.groovy` to make the application "cleaner".

First, it's obvious that the `Ratpack.groovy` file has grown a lot and
maybe is time to clean it up. I'm going to move the datasource to a
provider to be able to use a configuration file to get the connection
that from it.

Then to take the function responsible for executing the query outside
`SchemaProvider.groovy`. To do that I'm creating
`fortune.CookiesService` which will be wrapping the database querying.

[source, groovy]
.CookieService.groovy
----
include::{ratpack}/src/main/groovy/fortune/CookiesService.groovy[indent=0]
----

Then we also have to extract the DataSource declaration and if
possible read the database properties from a yaml configuration
file. In order to do that I'm moving the data source declaration from
`Ratpack.groovy` to `fortune.DataSourceProvider`:

[source, groovy]
.DataSourceProvider.groovy
----
include::{ratpack}/src/main/groovy/fortune/DataSourceProvider.groovy[indent=0]
----

<1> We declare the necessity to get an instance of Map. The only map
registered in the registry is the configuration information
<2> The provider returns an instance of `javax.sql.DataSource`

IMPORTANT: As we'll see in a moment the only `Map` injected in the
registry is the configuration file information, that's why this is
working. For a production application would be better to create your
own configuration class, Map is too generic I'm afraid.

Of course having all fixtures in the `Ratpack.groovy` file is not a
very good idea. Although it could be a good idea to use a tool such as
Flyway, for the moment I'm ok with just moving it outside the
`Ratpack.groovy` file. I'm creating a Ratpack service. Ratpack services
are aware of Ratpack's lifecycle, so it's easy to register a service
to run only during application startup.

[source, groovy]
.FixturesService.groovy
----
include::{ratpack}/src/main/groovy/fortune/FixturesService.groovy[indent=0]
----

Now that we have break things apart we need to create the module that
will glue them all. That module will be registered later in the
`Ratpack.groovy` file. This module will be an instance of
https://github.com/google/guice[Google Guice] `AbstractModule`. Guice
is integrated with Ratpack, in fact Ratpack's modules are built on top
of Guice modules.

[source, groovy]
.FortuneModule.groovy
----
include::{ratpack}/src/main/groovy/fortune/FortuneModule.groovy[indent=0]
----

<1> The `GraphQLSchema` dependencies be loaded using the `SchemaProvider` class
<2> The `DataSource` dependencies will be loaded using the `DataSourceProvider` class
<3> The `Service` dependencies will be loaded using the `FixturesService` class
<4> Use `CookiesService` class to create instances of the same class

In all cases we told Guice to reuse the same instance for all
dependencies in the app (Scopes.SINGLETON)

Ok we're almost done, the only thing we need to do is to load the
configuration file, and register the `FortuneModule` we have just
created.

[source, groovy]
.Ratpack.groovy
----
include::{ratpack}/src/ratpack/Ratpack.groovy[tags=refactored, indent=0]
----

<1> The configuration will be exposed as a `Map`. So that everytime
someone ask for a `Map` instance in the Ratpack's registry a map with
the configuration will be returned.
<2> Register the `FortuneModule` to register all clases already
registered in that module

Now our application looks better and it's ready to keep growing. The
chosen approach has been based on `dependency injection` and OOP
paradigm, but it could also be possible to use a more functional
approach.
