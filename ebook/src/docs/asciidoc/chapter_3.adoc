=== Schema

Instead of coding the schema with Groovy we're going to use GraphQL
syntax directly modularising the schema. Modularising the way you
create GraphQL schemas has at least a couple of benefits:

Enables you to write using plain GraphQL language: Writing code is
cool, but you may be used to writing GraphQL schemas using the GraphQL
language directly.

It allows you to separate parts of the schema by areas of interest: No
more a huge single file declaring everything in one place

=== Handling errors

NOTE: You can check how `graphql-java` handles exception during query
execution at http://graphql-java.readthedocs.io/en/v7/execution.html
